### Project Overview

This is a data analysis project that aims at giving insight on the top 10 countries by case fatality rate. By analyzing various aspects of the data we seek to indentify treds in covid-19 cases, make data-driven decisions and gain deeper undestanding of the trends in the covid-19 cases by country. 

### Data sources

Covid-19 dataset : The primary dataset used for this analysis is 'country_wise_latest.csv' file this dataset contains information on covid-19 cases based on countries.

### Tools

- Pandas - Data cleaning
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib - Data vizualization
- Excel - Data cleaning

### Data cleaning/preparation

In the initial data preparation phase I performed the following;
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exporing the covid-19 data and answering key questions such as;
- what are the cases trends?
- which countries reported the highest cases?
- what was the case trend?

### Data analysis

Include some interesting code worke with

```df = pd.read_csv('country_wise_latest.csv') ```
### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows;
1. Yemen has the highest case fatality rate (CFR)
2. Fiji has the lowest confirmed cases
